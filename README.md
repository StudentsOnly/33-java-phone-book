## Exercise: Simple Phone Book

#### Objective:

Practice using HashMap to create a basic phone book.

#### Description:

Create a program that simulates a simple phone book using a HashMap. The program should allow users to add contact names and their corresponding phone numbers, look up phone numbers using contact names, display the phone book, and exit the program.

#### Guidelines:

- Create a HashMap to store contact names as keys and their corresponding phone numbers as values.
- Implement a loop that displays a menu with the following options:
    - Add contact
    - Look up phone number
    - Display phone book
    - Exit

Depending on the selected option, perform the following tasks:

1. To add a contact, take input from the user for the contact's name and phone number, and add it to the HashMap.
2. To look up a phone number, take input from the user for the contact's name and retrieve the corresponding phone number from the HashMap.
3. To display the phone book, iterate through the HashMap and print each contact's name and phone number.
4. To exit, terminate the program.
